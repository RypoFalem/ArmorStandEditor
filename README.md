## Adding ArmorStandEditor as a Dependency
ArmorStandEditor has an API and is supported through [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#Wolfieheart/ArmorStandEditor). The Source Code for that API can be found [here](https://github.com/Wolfieheart/ArmorStandEditor/src/main/java/io/github/rypofalem/armorstandeditor/api). 
You can find an example plugin [here](https://github.com/Wolfieheart/ArmorStandEditor/API-Example-Plugin/src/main/java/io/github/rypofalem/apiexample). It contains very basic tests and examples of what you could do with such an API.

For Maven Users, if you want to interact directly, you need to add the following to your pom.xml file:
```XML
     <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
     </repository>
```
